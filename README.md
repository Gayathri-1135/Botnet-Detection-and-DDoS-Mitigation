This project is about detecting botnet attacks and DDoS attacks using Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques.

A botnet is a group of infected devices controlled by an attacker. These devices are often used to perform DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks, where a large amount of fake traffic is sent to a server to make it unavailable for real users.

The goal of this project is to identify malicious network traffic and help the system take proper defense actions.
